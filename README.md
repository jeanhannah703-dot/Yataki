# **System Description**

## 📊 Sensor Data Monitoring and Forecasting System

A full-stack Flask web application for logging, visualizing, and forecasting telemetry sensor data — including step counts, voltage, and current readings. The system includes a rich dashboard interface with interactive charts, exportable reports, user authentication, and built-in forecasting models using linear regression.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧾 Data Management 
- Add logs manually via the dashboard - to be changed to automatic
- Log fields: `steps`, `raw_voltage`, `raw_current`, `datetime`, `battery_health`
- API to retrieve latest logs as JSON

### 📈 Dashboard and Visualization
- Real-time charts (voltage, current, steps) with pagination
- Summary tables with totals, averages, min/max values
- Daily, weekly, monthly filters and custom month selection

### 📉 Forecasting
- Predict next day's voltage and current via linear regression
- Identify the month with the highest predicted energy values
- Background thread automatically updates forecasts daily

### 📦 Data Export
- Export filtered sensor data or summary reports as `.csv`
- Custom date range selection for export

### 🔐 Authentication
- Secure login and registration (Admin only)
- Password hashing via `bcrypt`
- Session-based route protection

### 🌓 Dark Mode Support
- Toggle dark/light mode
- Preference saved in browser `localStorage`
